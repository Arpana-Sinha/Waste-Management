Clean Connect: Waste Management Platform (Frontend Prototype) 

This project is a robust frontend prototype demonstrating a modern web platform for efficient waste management. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it showcases a user-friendly interface for citizens to schedule pickups and register complaints, alongside a dedicated portal for waste management authorities to visualize incoming requests.
While this version focuses purely on the interactive user experience and design (without a live backend database), it lays a strong foundation for a fully functional system.

Key Features:

For Citizens (User Panel)
Intuitive Pickup Scheduling Interface:
Location Pinning: A dynamic map integration (OpenStreetMap) allows users to precisely pinpoint their location for pickup requests.
Direct Complaint & Feedback System:
Easy Reporting Forms: A clear interface to report issues like overflowing bins or missed pickups, demonstrating direct communication channels.
Contact Us Section: A dedicated form for general queries or suggestions, showcasing how user input would be gathered.

For Service Providers (Authority Portal)
Simulated Secure Login: A well-designed login page for waste collection agencies, demonstrating the entry point to their operational dashboard.
Visual Request Management Dashboard:
Overview of Requests: A clear display of incoming garbage pickup requests from citizens.
Complaint Resolution Interface: Demonstrates how authorities would view and manage citizen complaints.

Tech used:

HTML5: The backbone of the entire platform, providing semantic and accessible structure to all pages.
CSS3: Bringing everything to life with modern styling.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Powering all client-side interactivity, form validations, dynamic content updates, and simulated data handling
Map API Integration: Using a JavaScript API (OpenStreetMap) for location selection and display.
